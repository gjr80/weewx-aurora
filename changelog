v0.6.0
*   ported to Python 3
v0.5.2
*   implemented port cycling after 2 failures to obtain a response from the
    inverter
v0.5.1
*   updated readme
*   updated aurora.py install comments
v0.5.0
*   initial release as an extension
*   implemented port cycling to reset serial port after occasional CRC error
*   fixed issue where inverter date-time was never added to the raw loop packet 
    so could never be used as the resulting loop packet timestamp
*   added confeditor_loader() function
*   revised logging output format to be more consistent
*   added more arguments to AuroraInverter class
*   AuroraDriver send_cmd_with_crc() method now accepts additional arguments
*   refactored calculate_energy()
*   units, groups, conversions and formatting defaults are now defined in the 
    driver rather than via additions to extensions.py
*   renamed driver config option [[FieldMap]] to [[sensor_map]] and implemented 
    a default sensor map
v0.4.0
*   implemented setTime() method
v0.3.0
*   hex inverter response streams now printed as space separated bytes
*   fixed various typos
*   some test screen error output now syslog'ed
*   genLoopPackets() now produces 'None' packets when the inverter is off line
*   converted a number of class properties that were set on __init__ to
    @property that are queried when required
*   inverter state request response now decoded
*   added --monitor action to __main__
*   improved delay loop in genLoopPackets()
*   added usage instructions
v0.2.0
*   no longer use the aurora application for interrogating the inverter,
    communication with the inverter is now performed directly via the
    AuroraInverter class
v0.1.0
*   initial release
